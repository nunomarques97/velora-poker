## FORJA core
New FORJA tasks use Core. The conversation agent prepares the goal, starts the controller and reports its result; it does not act as Lead or manually dispatch the legacy crew.
Resolve `<forja>` from the caller-provided installation, `FORJA_ROOT`, or an existing FORJA hook path in `.claude/settings.json`. If unavailable, ask for the installation path; do not guess or install another copy.
Read `<forja>/docs/CORE.md` and `<forja>/docs/CORE-RUNBOOK.md`. From this project: `node "<forja>/bin/forja.mjs" start --goal "..." --provider claude|codex`. Supply the explicitly selected profile with `--config`; installing or updating FORJA does not select models.
The controller owns planning, development, checks and independent review. Workers read only the phase and applicable domain methods supplied in `specialist_context`. Do not load `forja-lead` or other legacy crew skills for Core work.
Core state and usage live in `.forja/`. Inspect existing changes before starting; preserve them and use `--allow-dirty` only when work on that snapshot is authorized. Git delivery requires explicit configuration and the controller delivery contract.
Preparation does not start a run. Never silently resume or replace an active Core or legacy run. Stop existing executors before an explicitly authorized handover; preserve their state and unfinished work.
Legacy `runner` and `run start` are compatibility commands only when explicitly requested. Their state remains in `docs/forja/`; read legacy methods as files for that workflow. Restart the conversation after migration to discard previously loaded legacy instructions.
